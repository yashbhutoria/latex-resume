    \begin{rSection}{Academic Research}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Decentralized storage with Filecoin}: This research aims to provide public universities with a better understanding of the role of decentralized storage protocols in their IT infrastructure, specifically Filecoin/IPFS. The team plans to evaluate which public data sets are suitable for storage using Filecoin, demonstrate a use case of decentralized computing over the data, and create an analytical model that shows the cost-benefit trade offs of using decentralized storage. The output of this research provides universities with valuable insights into the potential benefits and risks of adopting decentralized storage solutions, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their IT infrastructure.
            \item \textbf{Creating LLM-based Dynamic Analytics on CRM and ERP Systems}: This research aims to develop a system that can create dynamic queries and visualizations based on user input and apply natural language processing (NLP) to Customer
            Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. The project 
            will involve analyzing large amounts of data from various sources using LLaMA (Large 
            Language Model Meta AI) model and fine-tuning LLMs to specialized queries. The generated 
            queries will be used to create dynamic visualizations, providing users with real-time insights 
            into their CRM and ERP systems. The project used National Center for Super computing Applications Delta supercomputer at UIUC for compute.
